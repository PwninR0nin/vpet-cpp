# vpet-cpp
*My first attempt at making a vpet emulator. C++ seemed most appropriate with my existing background and experiences in addition the many resources available for similar projects.*

## Disclaimer 
This is an attempt at making an emulator for virtual pets for the sake of learnin and practicing reverse engineering. This project in no way promotes piracy and I have legally purchased the v-pets that I will be attempting to emulate. 
ROMs and other proprietary firmware will not be shared or distributed.
